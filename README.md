# FaceMaskDetection

## We open source all the popular deep learning frameworks' model and inference code to do face mask detection.
 + PyTorch
 + TensorFlow（include tflite and pb model）
 + Keras
 + MXNet
 + Caffe
 
 ** Detect faces and determine whether they are wearing mask.**

** First of all, we hope the people in the world defeat COVID-2019 as soon as possible. Stay strong, all the countries in the world.**

+ We make face mask detection models with five mainstream deep learning frameworks （PyTorch、TensorFlow、Keras、MXNet,Caffe） open sourced, and the corresponding inference codes.
